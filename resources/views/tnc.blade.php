          <h3>2. Formation of contract</h3>
          <p>Set out below is a summary of the steps which you must follow in order to conclude a legally binding contract with us:</p>
          <h4>(1) Browse our information</h4>
          <p>This website contains information about the Service which you will need to know before you register. The information about the Service on our website constitutes an "invitation to treat" and is not a contractual offer from us which you may accept. This means that we reserve the right to correct any errors in that information without liability to you. It also means that under no circumstances will we be contractually bound to supply you with the Service on the basis of any incorrect information, even if that information is repeated in your registration.</p>
          <h4>(2) Read our Terms and Conditions</h4>
          <p>It is your responsibility to read the legal terms on our website carefully and to raise any problems with us before you register. This includes these Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy. You will be asked to confirm that you agree to our Terms and Conditions before you register.</p>
          <h4>(3) Submit your registration</h4>
          <p>If you wish to proceed with your registration you should click the "Register" or "Sign Up" button. Input errors can be corrected at any time up to the point at which you submit your registration.</p>
          <h4>(4) Wait for verification</h4>
          <p>On receipt of your registration we will send you an email verification message confirming your details and the service to which you have registered. You may not assume we have accepted your registration until we send you verification by email. Only if and when you receive verification will we have a binding contract between us. We will be entitled to refuse to accept your registration if at our sole discretion we consider it necessary.</p>
          <h4>(5) Our Contract</h4>
          <p>The contract between us will consist of (1) these Terms and Conditions, (2) your registration and (3) our verification (“Contract”). Our Privacy Policy, Disclaimer and any additional legal terms or notices appearing on the Service or our website will also form part of the Contract between us.</p>
          <p>We will not file the concluded Contract between us online and you should therefore print out and retain copies of each element of the Contract. We can only conclude the Contract with you and provide the Service to you in English and not in any other language.</p>
